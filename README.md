# Postman Demo Page

This is a polished, responsive, and accessible demo webpage that displays an image and a submit box.

## Setup

Open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser. No server setup is required.

## Usage

Type a message into the input box and click the 'Submit' button. The message will be displayed below the form.

## Attachments

- **tiny.png**: A small sample image embedded directly into the HTML using a data URI.
- **sample.txt**: A sample text file included as a data URI, demonstrating how attachments can be integrated.

## Assumptions

- The image is embedded directly via a data URI for simplicity.
- The form performs client-side validation to ensure input is not empty.
- The app is designed to be accessible with ARIA labels and semantic HTML.
